# Quadruped locomotion

## Features
- Low-level joint force control
- Differential inverse kinematics control
- Support consistent differential inverse kinematics control
- TODO: COM zero moment point motion planner for any gait sequence

## Current plan
- [ ] Generalize to arbitrary feet in contact for HoQpController
- [ ] Implement end-effector task for HoQpController
- [ ] Fix support polygons from ZMP motion planner
- [ ] Fix gait sequence feet order
- [ ] Get end-effector trajectory from ZMP motion planner
- [ ] Get A and b from polygon
- [ ] Implement zmp constraints
- [ ] Implement current position as constraint on first spline
- [ ] (Make constraint on final position a soft one)
- [ ] (Implement path regularizer?)

The lines
```

```

must be added to the anymal_c_simple_description .urdf file for this to work.
